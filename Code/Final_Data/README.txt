The ASCII data files, output_XXX.txt give the following: 

quantity (XXX):

Radius (Units) Median XXX (Units) XXX_68%low XXX_68%high XXX_95%low XXX_95%high XXX_99%low XXX_99%high 

Units are kpc, Msun, km/s

The profiles are for the "non-parametric" mass profile described in Read et al. 18/19, but implementing a small bug fix in the stellar data binning. This does not produce any change within the 68% confidence intervals, but will yield slightly different results from published in those papers.
